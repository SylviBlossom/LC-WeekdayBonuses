# Weekday Bonuses
Adds repeating bonus events for certain days of the week to Lethal Company, inspired by [Double-Loot Wednesday](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SylviBlossom/WednesdayFix/). Events and the days they appear on can be configured.

The mod is currently WIP! Not all days have an event yet.
