# Weekday Bonuses
Adds repeating bonus events for certain days of the week to Lethal Company, inspired by [Double-Loot Wednesday](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SylviBlossom/WednesdayFix/). Events and the days they appear on can be configured.

## Bonuses

| Event Name     | Default Day | Event Description |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Double Monster | Monday      | Doubles the amount and rate at which monsters spawn. Comes with a free Old Bird on every moon. |
| Double Trap    | Tuesday     | Doubles the amount of hazards that spawn inside the facility. With enough speed, you can potentially make use of the landmines. |
| Double Loot    | Wednesday   | Doubles the amount of scrap that spawns inside the facility. |
| Small Facility | Thursday    | Decreases every facility size drastically (around experimentation size). |
| Black          | Friday      | Every store item is always on sale. By default, the sale is random but always at least 10% off. |
| Nightmare      | Saturday    | Every single event is active simultaneously. |
| Easter         | Sunday      | Spawns an additional large quantity of Easter Eggs in the facility. |
